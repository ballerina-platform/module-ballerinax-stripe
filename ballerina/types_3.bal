# Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
# your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
# object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
# event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
# `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple
# events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
# customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
# `charge.succeeded` event.
# 
# Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's data
# field embeds the resource's state at the time of the change. For
# example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an
# `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.
# 
# As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
# [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
# from the API. We also have a separate
# [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
# `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage
# webhooks in your
# [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how
# to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)
# so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.
# 
# When using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications
# that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there's an
# additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
# 
# We only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event)
