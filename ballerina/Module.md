## Overview

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a leading online payment processing platform that simplifies the handling of financial transactions over the Internet. Stripe is renowned for its ease of integration, comprehensive documentation, and robust API that supports a wide range of payment operations including credit card transactions, subscription management, and direct payouts to user bank accounts.

This connector facilitates the automation of various payment-related operations such as charge creation, customer management, billing, and direct payouts. By leveraging the Ballerina Stripe Connector, developers can build secure and scalable payment solutions that enhance the e-commerce capabilities of their applications.

```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a `stripe:ConnectionConfig` object with API token, and initialize the connector.

```ballerina
configurable string secretKey = ?;

stripe:ConnectionConfig configuration = {
    auth: {
        token: secretKey
    }
};

stripe:Client stripe = check new (configuration);
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Create a new customer

```ballerina
stripe:customers_body newCustomer = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@sample.com",
    address: {
        city: "Colombo",
        country: "Sri Lanka"
    }
