# PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed to your customers when you don't explicitly specify payment method types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of payment methods for different scenarios.

# There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the [charge type](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges):
# 
# **Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.
# 
# **Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.
# 
# Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are [managed in the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) and are not available in this API.

# You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.
# 
# Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products.
# [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
# 
# For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.
